# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Started a new project on Artificial Nueral Networks(ANN) 

**Thoughts:** This is part of a Udemy course, I'm currently enrolled in i.e, Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Nueral Networks

**Link to work:** https://github.com/Timmyy3000/ANN, Project is already up on github and linked here

### Day 2: June 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the ANN Project, I moved to Convolutional Nueral Networks (CNN)

**Thoughts:** Also part of the aforementioned Udemy Course, I'm trying to learn new concepts and better understand the fundamentals, so I can be more flexible and diverse in my various implementations of CNNs.

### Day 3: June 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More CNNs

**Thoughts:** Picked up from yesterday, still learning a lot about CNNs and their architectures

### Day 4: June 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CNN part of the series 

**Thoughts:** It was a basic CNN classifier trained to categorize Dog and Cat images. Planning to expand upon this idea though
